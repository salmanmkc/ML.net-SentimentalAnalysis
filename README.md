# ML.net-SentimentalAnalysis

**ML.netPricePredict3CSV** was the first project I made to test ML.net. From here I like to test things, I have customised the data set that I originally had, trying to make it more accurate, etc. So far I have got it to an accuracy of 90.91% with more data, which is great since I added more data and initially it dipped to 78% from being 88% before. The goal is to keep adding data to this and I should be able to create a very accurate sentimental analysis program. I may use my **old python program which I used to get the sentinmental analysis from twitter** and thhen import those tweets into the csv file that I have, or the data set that I was mining from twitter data, as to be a more realistic set of data, since I am trying to use my own data that I come up with or generate statements online.
